This tutorial will help you to transfer you passwords from Passman

00:06.060 --> 00:12.060
First, open Passman and log into your password vault

00:14.020 --> 00:20.020
Then click on "Settings" in the bottom left corner and open the "Export credentials" tab

00:20.120 --> 00:26.020
Choose the "Export type" "JSON" and enter your vault password in the password field

00:26.080 --> 00:32.080
After that, click the "Export" button and save the generated file on your computer

00:34.150 --> 00:40.150
If the export does not work, take a look at our list of known bugs and workarounds for help

00:43.050 --> 00:48.050
Now, open the Passwords app and click on "More" in the bottom left corner

00:48.100 --> 00:53.100
Then click on "Backup and Restore" and choose the option "Restore or import"

00:53.150 --> 01:01.000
Select "Passman JSON" as import format and open the file created by Passman using the file dialog

01:01.000 --> 01:04.500
Then, click on the "Import" button to start the import

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
After the import has finished, you should be able to see the imported passwords in the "Folders" section

01:15.150 --> 01:19.150
Repeat this process for all Passman vaults which you want to import

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
Don't forget to delete the export file from your computer, after you have successfully imported it

01:26.200 --> 01:32.000
Please note that the import does not support some of the options available in Passman

01:32.050 --> 01:36.150
In these cases the import may show a warning for the affected passwords

01:36.250 --> 01:42.250
You can take a look at our list of compatibility issues and workarounds to fix these issues
