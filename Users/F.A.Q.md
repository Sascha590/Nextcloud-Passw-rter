### Passwords tells me taht one of my passwords is insecure
If companies get hacked, the passwords of their users often end up in online databases of hacked passwords.
Because of this, the passwords app checks on a regular basis if one of your passwords appears in these databases and notifies you if it does.
This does not necessarily mean that you or the website which you use the password for have been hacked.
But you should change the password as hackers now have it in their databases as well.

### Password tells me that one of my passwords could not be shared
Given that the option is enabled, you can share passwords which have been shared with you.
By doing so, it might happen that the person you want to share the password with, is the one who originally shared it.
If that is the case, Passwords will not complete the sharing process as this would create an endless loop.

### I found a strange WebUi Device Token
When you use the Passwords app, a token called "Passwords WebUI Access" will appear in your device list.
This token was automatically generated to enable the app to access your passwords.
There should only be one token with this name and it should not have filesystem access.
If you don't use Passwords or the token appears more than once, you should delete it.
