## Security
### Password Generator
These settings define how the built-in password generator creates passwords.
You may be able to temporarily overwrite these settings when creating a password.
Your system administrator can choose which service is used to generate passwords.
Based on the service the actual generated password may differ.

##### Password strength
A higher password strength result in a more complex and longer password.
Every password will have at least 12 characters minimum.
With strength set to `3`, three words will be used and with `4` it will be four words.

##### Include numbers
If activated, the password generator will add numbers to the created password.

##### Include special characters
If activated, the password generator will add special characters like `$, €, @` to the created password.


## User Interface
##### Initial section
Here you can choose which section will be shown when you open the passwords app.
By default the `All Passwords` section will be shown, but you can also select your `Favourites`, `Folders`, `Tags` or `Recent` passwords as inital section.

### Password List View
These settings change how passwords are displayed in the list view.

##### Set title from
By default the name of the password will be shown in the list view.
You can also select the `Website` or the `Username` to be used.

##### Sort by
This option lets you choose which field will be used to sort passwords, when "Sort by Name" is selected in the list view.
By default the title field from the previous option will be used.
But you can also have your passwords sorted by `Name`, `Website` or `Username` independently from the title field.

##### Add copy options in menu
If this option is enabled, the options to copy the password and the username will always be shown in the `⋯`-menu.
By default these options are not visible since you can copy the password by clicking on the name and the username by clicking twice.
On mobile devices the options will always be shown regardless of this option.

##### Show tags in the list view
You can show the tags for a password in the list view.
If you click on a tag the tag section will be opened and you can see all passwords with the tag.
This will increase the loading times if you have a lot of tags.
Also the tags will not be shown on mobile devices.
