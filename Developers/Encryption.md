### How does Passwords implement CSE/E2E
Passwords uses [Libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc) to encrypt and decrypt user data.
Implementations of Libsodium are available for many different programming languages and usually provide a very similar api.
The library also provides good performance and security while being comparably easy to use.
E2E in Passwords is designed to be upgradeable which is why every part of it is implemented separately and has its own version information.


### Encryption and Token types
##### Password challenge
| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`PWDv1r1`](./Encryption/PWDv1Challenge) | The standard master password challenge |

##### Keychains
| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`CSEv1r1`](./Encryption/CSEv1Keychain) | The standard CSE keychain |

##### CSE/E2E encryption
The default CSE chosen by the user is set in `user.encryption.cse`.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | An object without any client side encryption. Only available with SSE other than `none` |
| [`CSEv1r1`](./Encryption/CSEv1Encryption) | The standard CSE encryption. Can not be used for shared entities. |

##### SSE encryption
The default CSE chosen by the user is set in `user.encryption.sse`.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | An object without any server side encryption. Only available with CSE other than `none` |
| `SSEv1r1` | An object with first generation server side encryption. Uses a server key, user key and object key |
| `SSEv1r2` | An object with second generation server side encryption. Uses the Nextcloud secret, user key and object key |
| `SSEv2r1` | An object with secure server side encryption. SSEv2 uses a keychain which is temporarily decrypted with the challenge secret |

##### 2FA token
| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`user-token`](./Token#user-token) | A token where the user has to enter a code |
| [`request-token`](./Token#request-token) | A token where a second device or app is used for confirmation |



### The encryption flow
This diagram explains the process which is necessary to use encryption.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    loop Authentication
        User->>Client: Requests login
        Client->>Server: Requests session
        click Server "http://www.github.com" "This is a link"
        Server->>Client: Challenge / Token
        Client->>User: Requests password / token
        User->>Client: Provides password / token
        Client->>Client: Solves challenge
        Client->>Server: Challenge solution / token
        Server->>Server: Validates challenge / token
        Server->>Client: Sends Keychain
    end
    Client->>Client: Decrypt keychain
    Client->>Client: Initialize encryption
    Client->>User: Report login success
    loop Object decryption
        Client->>Server: Requests objects
        Server->>Client: Sends objects
        Client->>Client: Decrypts objects
        Client->>User: Shows objects
    end
    loop Object encryption
        User->>Client: Changes objects
        Client->>Client: Encrypts objects
        Client->>Server: Sends objects
        Server->>Client: Confirms changes
        Client->>User: Shows changes
    end
```


### Set up encryption
This diagram explains the process which is necessary to set up encryption

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    User->>Client: Master password
    Client->>Client: Create challenge
    Client->>Server: Set challenge
    Server->>Server: Set up SSEv2
    Server->>Client: Success
    Client->>Client: Create keychain
    Client->>Server: Set keychain
    Server->>Client: Success
    Client->>User: Encryption enabled
    Client->>Client: Encrypt objects
    Client->>Server: Update objects
    Server->>Client: Success
    Client->>User: Shows objects
```

#### Notes
 - When migrating objects without encryption, it is recommended to delete the old object and create a new one


### Change the master password
This diagram explains the process which is necessary to change the users master password

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    User->>Client: New password
    Client->>Server: Get current challenge
    Client->>Client: Solve challenge
    Client->>Client: Create new challenge
    Client->>Server: Set challenge
    Server->>Server: Update SSEv2
    Server->>Client: Success
    Client->>Client: Add key to keychain
    Client->>Server: Set keychain
    Server->>Client: Success
    Client->>User: Password changed
```
