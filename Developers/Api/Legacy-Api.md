> **This api will be removed permanently in version 2022.1.**
> 
> This is the legacy api of the original passwords app by Fallon Turner.
> The rewritten passwords app provides an implementation of this api, but does not recommend using it.
> Due to its limitations, this api returns incomplete data and does not support client side encryption.
> If you are planning to use the passwords api in your own application, please use the new api instead.
