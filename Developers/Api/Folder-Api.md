#### Notes

 - If you unhide a folder no change to the folders and passwords in it will be made and they will remain hidden
 - If the `revision` argument is present, the value must match the latest revision or the action will fail with an error.
   This prevents the client from overwriting a more recent revision on the server with old data.

 - If the `edited` time is in the future, the current time will be used




# The delete action

| revision | string | The UUID of the new revision. Only if the folder was moved to the trash |

#### Notes
 - If a folder is moved to the trash, all passwords and folders in it will be suspended and hidden from list and find actions
 - If a folder is moved to the trash, the relations between tags and passwords in the folder will be hidden from the tag, but not the password
 - If a folder is deleted, all passwords and folders in it will be deleted as well
