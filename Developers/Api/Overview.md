### Api Version Scheme
The api follows this version scheme: `MAJOR.MINOR`.
A major version makes incompatible api changes.
A minor version adds new features.
Bugfixes and security fixes are not visible over the api.
Support for an old version of the api will be ended by a new major version of the app.

##### Special note for the initial release
The version 1.0 api is not complete at this point. It will be so by the beginning of 2019.
