## Why am i seeing this notification?
The passwords app contains a system for anonymized telemetry data called [server survey](../Server-Survey).
As admin of your Nextcloud instance, you are being asked if you would like to send that data.

## How do i stop the notifications?
Go into the "Passwords" section in the admin area, locate the "Server survey participation" setting and choose any option other than "Not set".

## Does the password app have tracking?
No.
You can see what data is sent on the [server survey](../Server-Survey) page.
