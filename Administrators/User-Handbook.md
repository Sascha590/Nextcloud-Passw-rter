Passwords features a build-in handbook to provide users with an easy to access help whenever they need it.
This handbook is constantly updated and will therefore be always fetched directly from our [github repository](https://github.com/marius-wieschollek/passwords/wiki).
If you are running an outdated version of Passwords, the handbook may be inaccurate.
Since the handbook resources will be fetched when they are requested, the handbook domain (raw.githubusercontent.com) will be whitelisted in the content security policy of the app.
