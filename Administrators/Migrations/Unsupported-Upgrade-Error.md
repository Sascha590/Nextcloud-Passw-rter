If you haven't updated the Passwords app in a long time, attempting to install the latest version of the app might result in an `UpgradeUnsupportedException`.
This is because the app ony supports updates from the previous major version (e.g. 2020.12.1 to 2021.1.0).

You can solve this issue by upgrading to the doing all necessary upgrades between the version of the app you had installed at the beginning and the current version.
To do so, you need to install the december version of the year your original version is from (eg. install 2019.12.1 if you had 2019.8.0).
Then install the january version of the next year (e.g. 2020.1.0) and then the december version of that year (e.g. 2020.12.1) and then the january version of the next year again until you have updated to the latest version.

You can get all versions from the [app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/passwords/releases).
